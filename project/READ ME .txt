1. We opened up the PROJI-HNS.txt file from client and send all the lines
one at a time. In the RS, the string was searched in the DNS table we created 
and if the hostname existed in the table. We sent the hostname + the value of that particular
key. Then we went and opened the 2nd socket which was connected with TS. Did the same thing over 
there, looked to the hostname in the table and returned it.


2. Our understanding is that the when the match isn't available, the RS sends back TSmachineName -NS 
back to the client. Where TSmachineName is the name of the machine where the TS is running. 
We think the project works because we tested it out with different texts.


3. Sending one line at a time, looking it up in the table, sending it back and then start
the next line was troublesome. We could only start out project with sending all the strings
for a a very long time. Other than that, connecting it remotely was an issue but it is fixed now. 

4. We learned a great deal from this project. creating two sockets in client and connecting 
it to two different servers was difficult to imagine but now after doing it, it doesnt
seem that bad.
